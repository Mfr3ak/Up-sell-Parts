# Up-sell-Parts
Parts up-sell is a expected to be a major revenue driver in the future and a means to capture the market share

But this is not a typrical recommendor system it has been tweaked in a manner as to include user inputs as as to get a better 
picture of the parts to be recommended.

Most of the calculations are carried out in Tableau (eg. Specificity of the recommended part)

Part recommendation is done at two levels.
  1. Based on Model Number
  2. Based on Vehicle Class
 
The final recommendation is a conbination of both the recommendations.
